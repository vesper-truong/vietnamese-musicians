I appreciate how the first 3 Gen’s have relatively simple designs that look like they could be real creatures. As time goes on, it feels like the Pokemon just get more and more over designed, adding unnecessary markings and appendages for no real reason. Anybody think that the fire starters closely resembled the Chinese zodiac?My only complaint is that Scorbunny and Chespin have the exact same face and I can never unsee itCyndaquil was my first Pokémon on Crystal.

This bunny though...ugh... making this choice hard.  Monkey is too adorable nothing beats gen 1 stillThree of these are not like the others...what even happened to the water starters Gen 5 onwards? they all look so dumb xDIt was cool when Pokémon looked like monsters and not marshmallows glued together by someone with Parkinson’s.Literally don't know any of them after Black and White. Welp thats what I get for not being able to afford a 3dsSince it goes 2 fire whatever 3 fire fighting 2 fire whatever can we confirm another fire fightingAll the generations have exactly 1 clear 4 legged pokemon. Although the last one is a little less clear I guess since i was gonna say sobble is a quadruped  but I could be wrong. Also if you look among them you can see that a lot share a similar design or body structure, such as Bulbasaur, turtwig, chickorita, and mudkip. (I probably didnt spell the names right but idrc)Scorbunny and chespin have to be related... They have the same faceOlha esses arrombadinhos fofos do caralhoWe need a water ape starter for the next generation. A sea monkey?Gen 1 baby. Nothing will ever beat the feeling 8 year old me had opening that bday present that contained Pokémon red and a GBC.OG3 are by far the best design.I think this is the first gen since 4 where I want all 3.For all that fire is my favorite type I actually tend to chose the grass starter. I’m 4:2 grass:fire for starter preference for the previous gens with gen 2 being a tie. I’ve never chosen a water starter though this gen may be the first depending on how their final evolutions look.This is the first time I'll probably do green instead of red. Missing onedid anyone else get let down by the names they had chosecan't wait to see the fan art guesses of what the new starters evolve intoAnyone know why after gen2 they started making all the water types soft and dopey ?And Bulbasaur is still the absolute best.they better not pull another fennekin with sobbleOmg does the baby red cat turn into the buff red cat in Smash Bros?!? \n",

Single (aka water potato) is best gen 8 starter imoIt's probably because I'm older but honestly, I feel like since gen 4 onwards the starters begin to feel pretty... idk. \"manufactured\"?I have a special place in my heart for Gen 6My first was temping who was yoursGotta love that Gen 4.

The early generations had the \"younger\" pokemon featured with small heads. For some reason the visualization of Charmander and Squirtle with small hears was more appealing and seemed more realistic. It seems the larger, even slightly larger, heads of the \"younger\" pokemon seems less realistic, even though we're talking about a cartoon. Smaller heads makes me think youth, weak, etc. but that that can be strengthened through evolution.Looking at this now is the first time I realise I basically always choose fire starters...Look how they massacred my boysDo you even MUDKIP BRO??fucking convoluted None will ever be as good as the original 3.I can see the changes in art styling between the generations, especially in the eyes.Anyone else noticed rabbit is albino Did anyone else hate the last game I think it was ? The Hawaii theme was making me cringe so hard it was unplayableGreninja FTWI don't even know which games are half of those from.I only know the first three top left...I think this is the first generation where I choose the Fire starter.Cool how they made another Mudkip.Been a solid fire starter.\n",

Judging from the looks of the starters at least.Ive been playing a lot of pokemon go recently and have some of these and didnt even realise they were starters(the last pokemon game i bought and played was GBA fire red. At this point, I realised how old I actually am. I realized that 4th gen is now actually the first half of the Pokémon life-cycle.It all stopped after gen 4 for me1st gen was the best. So the next community day after treecko will be Torchic looking forward to that.The last time I played a Pokemon game was when Diamond first released, and all I remember is thinking about how fresh and new everything looked. I've never even seen the starters past Gen 4. God damn it's been a long time.I don't get it how each next generation looks more ratarded than the previous ones. Originals just look like real pokemon, not like some shity Nikelodeon characters.Cyndaquil best starter ever.\n",

Personally Gens 1-3 still be my ultimate favorites.Totodile is still my all-time favouriteLitten is the only one that really doesn’t fit.They got shittier each generationyou forgot about pikachu, it was start pokemon in pokemon yellow...What’s with monkey starters?Wow.  I didnt realize there were this many... gen 1 was magical enough.  I cant even imagine trying to keep up now.  Im so oldGen1&2 will forever be best Damn, I only recognize the left side at this point. We old fam Everything on the right side seems odd for me. I'm old.Gen 1 is so iconic. All 3 are fantastic.Typhlosions eruption is bad ass and it was my favorite starter. I think it's lazy and sad how a lot starters  evolve into some bi bedal anthropomorphic freak. The fire cat from sun and moon was very cool until it turned into a lame ass wrestler. I have missed a lot of Pokémon. Holy shit. Treecko final evolution is my favorite.You'll never beat the original three in my opinion. Creatively designed and named, statistically very good and memorable.  Why are the first 2 gens so perfect and everything else is just blah they just get really out there and don’t even come close to looking like they could be real animals. I think that’s what makes them bad. Besides the fire type in gen 6 they pretty much all suck. The water type style also goes from cool or intimidating to just silly after gen 2 please give the bunny flaming ears when it evolves PLEASE GIVE IT FLAMING EARSGen 8 and my unintentional Grass/Fire/Grass/Water/repeat pattern still holds true. Really looking forward to seeing Sobble's evolutions.Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle, Chicarita, Cidaquill, Toadadial, pass, chick-something, mudkip, duno, chimchar, piplup, I have no clue on the rest!The new ones look like knock off Pokémon At this point I think the only thing that will make starters exciting again is the day they stop being nothing but Grass / Fire / Water.Yet no ones ever beaten Piplup as best starterIn order from first gen to last, my faves are: Grass, water, fire, water, water, grass, grass, grass.\n",

This could be the first time I get new favorite starters since Hoenn, and a change for all three typings too!

No love for Pokemon Yellow version?I stopped after gen 4, but I think I'm ready again with the new gen and It looks really good on the switch.I went fire up to Gen 5, then water for gen 6 and 7, and probably water again for gen 8.Bobbies[deleted]You can see where they started to run out of ideas.

I’m also wondering what they’ll do after gen 12 when there are no more zodiac animals. 😄They got dumb after Gen4Gen 1 for lifeI love the new weed monkeyThis just goes to show how generic and uninspired the starters have gotten...It like watch society decline.Prinplup is the best starterAre they serious? I only know a single name of these weirdo things. Most of these look like they are fucking auto-generated!Can't they give them other typings for once?

      "I think of the first three, Venusaur was mathematically the best choice-- just considering strengths/weaknesses vs the opponents you had to face in the game. I really liked grass types till X and Y. Chestnaut just didn't feel right to me. It was like a poor imitation of Torterra. I actually restarted my game and choose Greninja instead, while unaware of how meta they apparently were. Sun and Moon I liked Poplio and Rowlet, but decided to go grass again. I didn't regret it in the slightest. Chepin/Quilladin/Chestnaught were the weak link in the grass starters imo. Serperior and Torterra were my faves. Never really liked the fire types tbh.Problem with Treeko is that Grovyle was so much cooler than Sceptile. Grovyle was *awesome* and then Sceptile was an awkward-looking letdown.I aways picked the grass type.I'm only digging half of the grass starters. This new Grookey is a great addition, in my opinion.Grass starter for life. Started with Bulba, went with chikorita because my brothers went with the other 2 and then it became my standard tradition to always start with grass when i fell in love with Treeko. Sceptile is my favorite final stage starter and always will be. So Grookey Gang it is.Yeah, on my first playthrough of a generation, I pick grass.Decidueye was the dopest.Fowler is the best starter tho. I mean come on, he’s an owl and that instantly make them the best!Grass types all the way!Amen to thatPoison or put the opponent to sleep, leach seed, then watch them slowly wither away. Grass is by far the most effective against a higher level opponent. Love me that grass type. Aside from the seal in sun and moon I always pick water. For some reason the grass/ghost owl just seemed so much cooler.I nearly always picked the fire types, but that's because you usually can't get another fire type until halfway through the gameWhich two didn’t get water start?Same \n",

Loved the pokemon to bits, but man did pidgey do some heavy liftingFor me gen 3 is the only one where I like all the starters.

Feraligatr could stomp his way through the entire game aloneChikorita was weird looking, but actually useful sometimes, Totodile I hate and would always end up as an I'm slave because of convenience, and then Cyndaquil could use some work(just my dislike for Typhlosion's design) but he was good in general.This is the comment I was looking for.\n",

And, on top of that, Bulbasaur has very few PP on his main attacks (such as razor leaf), meaning that you constently need to batrack to a hospital while battling trainers on roads, and its even worse when you are lost in a cave.

      "Remaining Fire-types: Ox, Goat, Horse, and Snake.\n",
      "\n",
      "I, for one, would love to see a Fire/Poison-type.\n",
      "Gen 2 was my favorite. Except Chikorita, the worthless bastard. But Totodile and Cyndaquil made up for it \n",
      "All the starters? I think pikachu is going to have one heck of a surprised face when he doesn't see himself on this!\n",
      "I still think the first were the best.\n",
      "\\*Checks Chinese Zodiac\\* Yep, now we got a Rabbit in the fire starters\n",

      "Maybe that's purely because of my age and nostalgia, but there's a pretty hard transition from \"which one is the coolest?\" to \"which one is the most bearable?\" after Gen 4.\n",
      "Mudkip supreme\n",
      "Squirtle man through and through, but I'm pretty sure every gen I picked the fire starter otherwise.\n",
      "The new grass type looks like a furby and if my childhood has anything to say, its haunted by default.\n",

      "Something about these new fellars is off puttin'\n",
      "Idk how i feel about the grass monkey\n",
      "Honestly, in terms of appearance, I feel like the starters get worse as time goes on. I appreciate how the first 3 Gen’s have relatively simple designs that look like they could be real creatures. As time goes on, it feels like the Pokemon just get more and more over designed, adding unnecessary markings and appendages for no real reason. \n",
      "Anybody think that the fire starters closely resembled the Chinese zodiac?\n",
      "My only complaint is that Scorbunny and Chespin have the exact same face and I can never unsee it\n",
      "Cyndaquil was my first Pokémon on Crystal. He’s still my favorite starter (charmander is a close second).\n",

      "&#x200B;\n",
      "1st-3rd gen personal favorite \n",
      "Interesting to see the art direction change over 20 years.  The new starters look like circus animals or bad PBS cartoon animations and a lot less like wild animals.  Just my two cents.\n",
      "That would make a cool mousepad\n",
      "my first from each are, Bulbasaur, Totodile, Mudkip, Chimchar, Snivy, Froakie(?), Owl Boi\n",
      "I was a Gen 3 kid, I could never decide which starter to pick up so all 3 have big meaning to me\n",
      "Gen 2 is my favorite.  But I’ve been 7/7 in picking fire Pokémon in first play through so far\n",
      "Too many of these look similar. This frustrates me \n",
      "Chosen first starters per generation:\n",
      "\n",
      "Charmander, Totodile, Treeco, don't remember as I didn't like any of them, Snivy, Froakie, and Rowlet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Undecided between Scorbunny and Sobble for Sword/Shield.\n",
      "Grass monkey one doesn't that bad, it just forsed to be near greatest round owl in the universe, so it looks slightly worse\n",
      "4th gen was the last good one\n",
      "Gen 1 still the best\n",
      "I've only played the games on the left.\n",
      "I picked fire starter since I was tot,  ever single time.... This bunny though...ugh... making this choice hard.  Monkey is too adorable \n",
      "nothing beats gen 1 still\n",
      "Three of these are not like the others...\n",
      "what even happened to the water starters Gen 5 onwards? they all look so dumb xD\n",
